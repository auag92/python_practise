highest number for output: create matrix of that number (net matrix)

netmatrix	driving gate	driven gates (linked list)	value(1st column??)
1		input		a				0
2		input		a				1
3		input		b				0
4		a		b,c				u
5		b		output				u
6		input		c				1
7		c		output				u


first take that gate whose inputs are completely defined (a in this case)

1 set inputs for vector v
2 set all nets to "u"
3 find all gates whose inputs are completely defined and outputs are u
4 evaluate these gates and set outputs to 0 or 1
5 have all gates been evaluated??
no - go to 3
yes - stop


a test vector detects a fault if and only if Zf(t) != Z(t) ie output at two diff circuits should be diff

any gate is sensitized to f if output of gate = D or D'
